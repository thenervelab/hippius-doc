# Security

Hippius uses a mnemonic-based authentication system that provides secure access without requiring browser extensions or storing sensitive data. Your mnemonic phrase acts as both your identity and encryption key, giving you complete control over your account security.

:::warning

There is no "forgot password" option
No one, including our support team, can recover your access key
Losing your mnemonic means permanently losing access to your account

# Storage

Hippius offers two complementary storage systems, each with unique advantages:

1. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: Fully decentralized, content-addressed storage with blockchain-managed pinning
2. **Hybrid S3**: S3-compatible object storage with decentralized storage volumes
