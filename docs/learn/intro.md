# What is Hippius?

Hippius is a decentralized cloud storage platform powered by a custom Substrate blockchain, IPFS, and S3-compatible storage. Learn how it enables transparent, anonymous storage with blockchain trust.

# Chain

Hippius leverages Substrate's architecture to deliver a specialized blockchain optimized for decentralized storage and compute services.

# Security

Hippius uses a mnemonic-based authentication system that provides secure access without requiring browser extensions or storing sensitive data. Your mnemonic phrase acts as both your identity and encryption key, giving you complete control over your account security.

There is no "forgot password" option
No one, including our support team, can recover your access key
Losing your mnemonic means permanently losing access to your account

# Confidential Computing

Hippius Confidential Compute (HCC) runs your workloads inside AMD SEV-SNP encrypted virtual machines. The host system cannot read VM memory, and continuous TPM attestation proves the environment has not been tampered with.

# Storage

Hippius offers two complementary storage systems, each with unique advantages:

1. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: Fully decentralized, content-addressed storage with blockchain-managed pinning
2. **Hybrid S3**: S3-compatible object storage with decentralized storage volumes
