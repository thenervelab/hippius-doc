# Substrate Framework

Substrate is a modular blockchain development framework created by Parity Technologies. It provides a flexible foundation for building custom blockchains without having to implement every component from scratch.

**Key benefits of Substrate for Hippius:**

- **Modularity**: Customizable runtime modules (pallets) for specific functionality
- **Upgradability**: Forkless runtime upgrades via on-chain governance
- **Performance**: Efficient, lightweight client with WebAssembly execution
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various consensus mechanisms and network designs

Hippius leverages Substrate's architecture to deliver a specialized blockchain optimized for decentralized storage and compute services.
