## Introduction

We’ve developed a secure, reliable wallet that enables you to send Alpha tokens and access the console to add credits when needed.

Your wallet balance is fully accessible, and you can transfer funds at any time. A detailed transaction history is also provided so you can track your spending and see the cost of file uploads. Additionally, our address book feature lets you save frequently used wallets for easy access on Hippius.

Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
