# Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)

Hippius uses Nominated Proof-of-Stake to secure the network and distribute block rewards efficiently.

**Key components of NPoS:**
1. **Validators**: Node operators who produce blocks and validate transactions
2. **Nominators**: Token holders who stake their tokens to support validators
3. **Stake-weighted selection**: Validators are selected based on total stake (their own plus nominations)
4. **Reward distribution**: Rewards are distributed proportionally to stake

**Benefits of NPoS:**
- More energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work systems
- Broader participation than traditional Proof-of-Stake
- Economic security through stake slashing for malicious behavior
- Lower barrier to participation through nomination
