## Introduction

Our file system is one of our core innovations, offering a unique, decentralized approach to storage. Designed to be efficient and accessible, it was built with a strong focus on security and privacy. All files uploaded to Hippius are stored privately and encrypted for security. Let's get started.

## Uploading Files

Files uploaded to Hippius are automatically added to your sync folder and encrypted for security. This ensures your data remains private and protected.

<Ordered>
  <li>Double click the <Icon /> icon to open the app.</li>
